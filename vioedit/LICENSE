Qt supports GIF reading if it is configured that way during installation. If it is, we are
required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

Warning: If you are in a country that recognizes software patents and in which Unisys
holds a patent on LZW compression and/or decompression and you want to use GIF, Unisys may
require you to license that technology. Such countries include Canada, Japan, the US,
France, Germany, Italy and the UK.

GIF support may be removed completely in a future version of Qt. We recommend using the
MNG or PNG format.

Parts of the FreeType projects have been modified and put into Qt for use in the painting
subsystem. These files are ftraster.h, ftraster.c, ftgrays.h and ftgrays.c. The following
modifications has been made to these files:

    * Renamed FT_ and ft_ symbols to QT_FT_ and qt_ft_ to avoid name conflicts in
    * qrasterdefs_p.h.  Removed parts of code not relevant when compiled with _STANDALONE_
    * defined.  Changed behavior in ftraster.c to follow X polygon filling rules.
    * Implemented support in ftraster.c for winding / odd even polygon fill rules.
    * Replaced bitmap generation with span generation in ftraster.c.  Renamed ftraster.h
    * as qblackraster_p.h.  Renamed ftraster.c as qblackraster.c.  Renamed ftgrays.h as
    * qgrayraster_p.h.  Renamed ftgrays.c as qgrayraster.c.
